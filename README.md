The two artifacts I believe I did the best on in this course are the Morse Code / SOS blinking LEDs Milestone and the final project, which required me to create a
prototype for a thermostat that could raise and lower temperatures based upon a heat sensor and the use of interrupts on a microprocessor. I feel that because I was 
able to create code that made the programs run successfully, the code itself is what I was particularly good at. However, I know for a fact that my code needs to be 
organized better and cleaned up so it can be better understood by any programmer who looks at it.

I am adding one really useful tool to my toolbox – that of microprocessors and their unique ability to be used in IoT devices. Microprocessors are really neat, tiny, 
versatile gadgets that can be programmed in so many ways to do so many things, and these things can serve to make a person’s life easier and more streamlined. Some 
examples of this are washing machines with timers, lights that turn on and off by an app or by detecting whether someone is in the room, and thermostats that can 
sense heat and turn on or off based upon a preset setting. 

In these projects, I learned how to create a state machine, which is a great way of organizing my thought process before writing down code. The use of organizational 
tools such as a state machine is an excellent way to transfer the skills I gained in this course to another course in the future.

I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by commenting my code, using “real” language to name my functions, and keeping the code aligned so it is 
neater and easier to read.
